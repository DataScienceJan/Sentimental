wmx8pw,emotions,Weekend check up - How have you been feeling?,"Share your feelings and emotions.

**Tip:**

A great way to keep daily track of your feelings (of your being) is by using the [Daylio app](https://daylio.net/). It's available for Android and iOS.

**How to use this app**

Use this app to track your needs, not you thoughts:

* Sit back close your eyes in a quiet room.
* Clear your mind.
* Feel what your body signs you.

Best is to track the stress level of your body:

* **Worst** = Depression, Extemely Tired, Unhappy, Very, very emotional.
* **Best** = Fit, Energetic, Happy, Emotional rest.

Focus on getting physical healty, so you'll have energy again to do the things you love to do (social/hobbies):

* Eat nutrious foods (You are what you eat).
* Drink enough water to clean your body of waste.
* Rest/sleep to destress your body and gain energy.
* Exercise daily: walking (45min) or cardio (20min).

It's about taking control of your life and loving yourself. You deserve to be healthy, fit, loved and fulfilled.

1iqcysc,emotions,Conflicted Between My Emotions and Rational Thinking,"I‚Äôm struggling with a situation where my emotions and rational thinking are pulling me in opposite directions.

I was involved with someone for a long time, and despite setting a clear boundary that I didn‚Äôt want a purely sexual connection, he recently reached out with a highly sexual message. I didn‚Äôt respond. Part of me feels like I did the right thing by disengaging, but another part of me still feels drawn to him. In the past, after periods of no contact, he has always found a way to come back‚Äîwhether through messages, liking my posts, or watching my stories.

Now, I find myself wondering: Should I keep ignoring him and hold my ground, or should I acknowledge his message in some way? I don‚Äôt want to seem offended or overly emotional, but I also don‚Äôt want to give the wrong impression. I know that responding might just lead me back into the same cycle, but staying silent makes me feel restless.

1iporm2,emotions,I am so annoyed with living with my sisters,"I 20m in college commuting am living in a house with my 3 sisters and parents.

Sister 1 is 27 years old and is quite annoying to be around. She speaks my name in a high pitched voice whenever I see her, and it makes me cringe every time she does it. She also doesn't like saving money for any long term goal since she doesn't see any worth in doing so apparently. I would consider her a shopaholic seeing that she can't go a week without buying tiny mystery box things. She also always has to eat out even though my dad always makes food every day, but does it because she can't eat the same thing everyday. She always likes to talk about her work or something irrelevant to vent or something, but I am literally not interested. She also is only moving out once she finishes her online school in 4 years. I find her to be a big baby that just hasn't grown up yet.

Sister 2 is 23 years old and is my least favorite. She is a complete pushover and people pleaser. She was bullied heavily by sister 1 growing up into essentially becoming her servant now. This could be a me problem but, she tells me her opinions about pop culture and I find it so disingenuous since I take her as not being pop savvy and just a way to fit into the conversation I have with my other sisters. She also is a massive germaphobe and once she leaves her room she can't spend time back in there unless she showers even if she just goes to the living room.I just feel like my annoyances with her are so big my resentment of her has grown equally.

SIster 3 is 19 years old and is just a young brat. She works at a fine dining restaurant and constantly brags about being better than the rest of us. She is a slob and leaves dirty dish plates on the kitchen table never putting them in the sink. She always talks to me in a monotone serial killer voice or she just stares are whenever I see her in the house.",Ok_Cartographer7415,1,1739577639,0

1iobveb,emotions,Why do people insist you are yelling when you are talking calmly and they are the only one raising their voice??,For context sometimes I will try to talk to my mom about something I'm talking normal. Today I asked her for a pain pill. That's it. She says you can't have a pain pill five days before a colonoscopy. I told her that's not true and I go and get my list of everything I can't have for pills and that's not on it. I tried to show her. Then she is getting louder saying she's not stupid and goes off saying that her problems are bigger than mine and I have no right to complain about anything because  my life is perfect and I'm a whiny little baby etc just mean comments (she says things like this every time I try to vent to her too so I don't anymore as she makes me feel worse). Anyways to the point I told her that was all rude and uncalled for. And she says well you're the one yelling. But I was talking calmly and she wasn't. She got loud and yelled and I talked softly. I don't understand why her and my sister are like this because my sister does the same thing. They are both geminis too they are alike in other ways. I've never met anyone else like this though. They will never admit when they are in the wrong and think everyone else it the problem that's another thing. But honestly i wonder how they genuinely think in their head that someone is yelling whenever someone disagrees with them regardless of their tone of voice.

1imb9xn,emotions,I feel like I‚Äôm over empathetic and it‚Äôs ruining me,"There are a lot of things that I think are unfair and I always wonder why I am so lucky. I guess the main thing that makes me so emotional all the time is my parents. Obviously they‚Äôre getting older, and I feel like they haven‚Äôt lived the life they wanted to. Not that they‚Äôre dying anytime soon, but financially, I know they won‚Äôt be able to do half of the things they deserve. My parents are amazing people and have given me everything I‚Äôve ever wanted, and supported me even when I didn‚Äôt deserve their help. I guess what gets me the most upset is my mom. She came to America when she was only 20, and she never got to fully live out her 20s. She didn‚Äôt go to college or have a dating life until my dad. It pains me so much when I think about how I am lucky enough to be a young woman in my 20s that gets to go out with my friends, travel, date different guys, (typical things to do in your 20s) and not have to worry about providing for myself. Me and my sisters are my moms entire life. She still works a full time job, as well as my dad. Like, she‚Äôs just been working her whole life. I guess I just don‚Äôt know where to put all of these feelings. I think about it so often and it kills me. Like completely ruins my mood and makes me not want to do anything. Is this just me????

1ije2pm,emotions,The start of my expressions,"I have always been good at articulating my emotions and feelings into words written down. When I speak my brain is going a mile a minute with words flying out before I can think of the consequence. When written I methodically pick words to express these feelings. I gain a deep appreciation into what these emotions mean to me and how to exactly capture them. 
Most people want to be seen but for me I crave to be heard. This craving is not something I want from all, not even by some; but the one I specifically desire to understand me and where I come from. 
Most people including myself words tend to be heard but not truly absorbed. The words spoken seem to be bouncing off or as some say go through one ear and out the other. For myself my brain is cluttered either honing in on specific words, the meaning. Could be focused on responses, rebuttals, or just focused on the world around me. I don't blame others for not listening because I know the challenges that can come with true undivided attention. 
When reading the written word it's plain and simple, its the text, you have to taken each word to get to the next. In my perspective the words have a greater meaning because we take in each word moving to the next with growing understanding. Yes, people can skim over the text. For many we soak it in creating vivid pictures in our mind of what we persevere the words mean. 
For me the goal in this is to be heard and understood. We all deserve that much in life, right?

1ifralv,emotions,Self Lerning Time,"M 29

Took a trip to Japan alone recently. I took the time to meditate and reflect on who I am. Along the trip I met nice, friendly people, and felt super genuine. I wanted to try and be social and to find genuine experiences to see if I'd go back. I spent 2 weeks there alone! I didn't feel to lonely and I enjoyed at least felt like being myself is a joy for others. Even with strangers, I always felt like the people I met on my trip got to experience my personality in a positive way. 

I haven't dated in many years, or at least wasn't open to it until recently. I have so many questions and at times I feel alot of emotional build up üòî. I feel at times super ready to meet people and show the world who I can be, but at times I feel like it takes to long to show people I meet. But I also value people friendship. I guess at times it feels like I'm maybe unattractive and that I have work hard than normal for a genuine partner. I don't feel alone, but dating apps feel kinda odd. Regardless, my trip gave me time to think...even if a I am looking for people to spend quality time with would that be enough for me to feel happy? I feel I spend time making my self happy, would others accept me and be as well? I've recently felt my friendships have given more reasons to enjoy people time. None of my past relationship were with people I could stay friend with, but I chose that as well. At the end I figure to many questions is a bogus way to enjoy time with people so I brush it aside, and I wish i had the vulnerablility to be serious at times. I've  liked people that had been friends and never said anything until later as well, and I felt very guilty. Am I a disservice for not noticing things like this?

I am open for advice/comments, but not sure if what I'm explaining makes sense. Maybe part of growing older and maturing? I thought I'd post for genral advice, because i didnt know what questions im truely asking myself yet, and it would be nice to know if anyone has experienced anthing similar.

I wish I could see her in a romantic way so something about 'this' would make sense but no I'm almost 600% sure its not affection but maybe just her traits that make me freeze up; like her awkward lips pressed together when she smiles and the soft voice that draws me in can't help but disperse in my mind enough for me to want to see her in my camera roll but it also disgusts me in a chilling way since there's no point of adoring someone who you are Never going to be normal towards.

Feelings collide, no warning, no sign. Happy, then heavy, all tangled in time. One minute I‚Äôm fine, the next I‚Äôm a mess. A pendulum swinging in quiet unrest

I‚Äôm spinning in circles, I‚Äôm up, then I‚Äôm down. My heart wants the sky, but my feet hug the ground. I envy the birds who never seem torn. They just rise and they soar like it‚Äôs what they were born

One hand grips hope, the other holds fear. Caught in the balance, but the answer‚Äôs unclear. The same things that lift me tear me apart. A bittersweet echo, it hums in my heart

Maybe I‚Äôm numb, or maybe I feel. Everything at once, so painfully real. I‚Äôm here and I‚Äôm there, I‚Äôm nowhere and all. A heart split in two, answering both calls

I‚Äôm in-between places, still and on the run. Forever the moon chasing after the sun. Confused but alive, I guess that‚Äôs the art. Two places at once, one fractured heart

1i7br92,emotions,"Single men of Reddit, where do you meet your emotional needs?","It has long been known that the emotionality of men and women is different. I don't want to delve into whether the reason is differences in biology or upbringing. 
Women usually have an extensive social support system. They often have closer and more satisfying relationships with family and friends. Women usually have several people close to their hearts, which gives them a sense of belonging and support, and it is to them that they turn to with their problems and difficulties that they encounter.
For men, sharing emotions, especially more difficult ones, is more limited. They are less likely to inform their surroundings about problems at work, dissatisfaction with themselves and other difficulties. Very often, the only person such a man can complain to is his partner. 
Personally, I believe that women often find it much easier to get over a breakup because they have a much larger emotional support system, and in the case of men, when there is no partner, there is no one to complain to, which leaves the man alone with his sadness and regret. Hence my question: where do you satisfy your emotional needs? Who do you tell about what makes you sad, upset or angry? Is it family, friends, or maybe you don't have such a person at all? I know I'm looking at it from a female point of view and maybe men's emotional needs are lower than women's, but that's not to say they don't exist.",ThrowRA_seitan,2,1737554525,3

I, 37F have been married to hubs 38M for 11 years. No problems for the most part. This morning he shocked me when he casually told me he was going to hit the gym. We do not have a gym membership. Well, apparently he does. He says he has been going for three months (I even verified the bank statements because I just could not believe it). I am a teacher, so I leave the house early with our three kids (ages 7 and below), and we do not get home until around 4:00 PM. He works from home unless he is visiting clients, and he plays basketball three mornings per week with a local club. I do not keep him on a leash, but typically I know where he is during the day if he is going to be out of the house. He would always let me know, ""hey I'm going here and here today"", etc. I do not like the idea that he did not tell me. I consider it lying by omission.  He did mention a while back that he was thinking about joining because the guys he plays basketball with kept cancelling on him and they wouldn't have enough to play. I would not have cared if he joined but I did make a ""Well that must be nice."" kind of comment when he mentioned it in relation to how much more free time he has than me. He recognizes this -during the school year I am very busy with work and my own kids. I would not have cared if he had told me. But I just cannot move past him never mentioning it in all this time. Aside from him just going somewhere regularly without telling me, he also had to pay a big fee to join, and then the monthly fee. We are not broke but not rich either, and I never would have spent that amount of money without mentioning it to him (our finances are combined). I also would not have been going somewhere multiple times per week without mentioning it. It weirds me out, like where else is he going in secret?

In a drama happening weirdly over 1 year, one user asks:

""Hi there, I'm looking for recourses on the truth about apartheid, from an Afrikaner perspective. I'm tired of endless nonsense propaganda - any help will be appreciated. Thanks in advance.""

**A few users find the question a bit odd and point out the obvious :**

1. [It depends what you mean by truth. The practical aspects of Apartheid are pretty well documented, so that 'truth' is secure, I'd say. And it's probably the closest you will get to any kind of meaningful truth.](https://www.reddit.com/r/afrikaans/comments/1b2yd6s/comment/ksoo62j/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)
2. [Here is a crazy thought, nothing actually changed. Things stayed exactly the same. Sure black South Africans have more rights freedom and liberty on paper, but they live exactly the same lives. Waking up at 4am to catch taxis to the wealthy areas to work for little money only to pay half of their days wages traveling home.](https://www.reddit.com/r/afrikaans/comments/1b2yd6s/comment/kspxium/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

3)[ LOL you can't casually say ""sure they have basic human rights now"" but nothing actually changed. Also Apartheid literally WAS about race. Did you miss the part where people were split by race? Did you miss the ""NO BLACKS"" sign?](https://www.reddit.com/r/afrikaans/comments/1b2yd6s/comment/ksqs7iu/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

4) [The fact that you are referring to the facts as propaganda means that you are already biased against the knowledge of the wrongs committed by the Apartheid government and you are asking this in bad faith.](https://www.reddit.com/r/afrikaans/comments/1b2yd6s/comment/ksp6wgv/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

5) It's not possible to view it from an angle that justifies apartheid. Sure some things are focused on more than others, but in the end one group took control and benefitted from screwing over other groups. There's much more to it and you can't really talk about it without offending a whole bunch of people. It's one of those topics that's better to discuss with someone you know rather than with strangers on the internet.

**Some Users have a diffrent take:**

**1)**  [They scraped by. Currently, I'm scraping by. Nothing has really changed besides the rightful reconstitution of our social landscape. It makes me cringe every time (white)privilege is brought up because I almost feel guilty over something I never got the privilege of having to begin with.](https://www.reddit.com/r/afrikaans/comments/1b2yd6s/comment/ksq5q52/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)I just wish that we could move past the past and focus on the future

2) I[n short, Afrikaaner nationalism developed after the Boer war, where Afrikaaners were oppressed by the British empire.](https://www.reddit.com/r/afrikaans/comments/1b2yd6s/comment/ksots2a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)  
That led to the belief that Afrikaaners needed to protect themselves, their culture etc. There is nothing inherently wrong with that, but in the context, this was ""mixed"" with a lot of the racist ideas that were prevalent at the time in much of the world. Part of that came fromt he fact that there was a fear in the elite that the poor white (mostly Afrikaans-speakers), would join forces with the black population and overthrow the elite. Divide and conquer style.

When WW2 ended and the rest of the world began to change, the Afrikaaner nationalist assumed political power and doubled down on their belief system. Perhaps this had to do with generational trauma not unlike what you see in Israel today.

3) [ Apartheid was never intended to have whites as a Supreme race. Rather have all cultures achieve their best. The fault was that the white minority held most of the land.](https://www.reddit.com/r/afrikaans/comments/1b2yd6s/comment/ksp7imz/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

4)  Fu3k off Anglos, you fu3king hateful people. You point the finger at the Afrikaners. But as you say, ""the rest of us go shafted"". 3uck off with your victim playing. You Brits did that to Us Afrikaners and the Bantu peoples of South-Africa, and now you want to come in here and suddenly play victim.

You Brits brought Apartheid to this country, you British English cuntes are the problem, back then as well as today. So shut up.

5) [Apartheid is the last time africa had anything going for it, now China own half the continent, because the Chinese are so good about human rights‚Ä¶.

6) [Bingo. Don't drink the white guilt kool-aid of all these self-hating whites. It's truly pathetic the way they sacrifice themselves on the altar of anti-whiteness for some kind of moral brownie points.](https://www.reddit.com/r/afrikaans/comments/1b2yd6s/comment/map1ssg/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)",Kenyalite,51,1739901649,6

/r/MURICA was created 10 years ago as a fun satirical shitpost subreddit with the same attitude you'd recognize from South Park's ""America Fuck Yeah"" song. One of the foundational rules is/was ""No Politics.""

The sub is now unmoderated. The same team is in place as it was a decade ago. Only one of the accounts is active, but they moderate hundreds of subs and don't pay attention. It's the wild west and anything goes.

After the latest election, more and more Conservative/Trump supporters have flocked to the sub and regularly post unironic cringe political shit. 

Posts are praising Ronald Regan, celebrating shit like the Gulf of America, posting tweets from DJT and Marco Rubio threatening terrorists. 

It's become a free-for-all THE_DONALD v2 at this point.

## Today's Discussion

[A post is made](https://old.reddit.com/r/MURICA/comments/1irnabs/anyone_else_looking_forward_to_the_new_golden_age/) about a bill that would authorize Trump to issue letters of marque and reprisal. This is an old constitutional power that allows Congress to authorize private individuals or groups (essentially privateers or mercenaries) to conduct military-style actions against foreign threats, in this case, drug cartels.

Unsurprisingly, they fucking *love* this idea.

That is why he cannot leave the states to meet with foreign leaders or enter specific countries due to being a convicted felon.  As for the civil case he was determined to be a r4pist by the judges own words but due to the statute of limitations on sexual assault he couldn't be tried in criminal court.

Continues into a full and bushy tree of arguments spanning dozens of comments. Generally circling around two guys insulting each other's manliness, with one generally focusing on Australians and the other on his opponent's father's drug addiction.

Here are some of my favorites:

> It‚Äôs ok mate, we all have family here that Island hopped and saved your land. We know the worth of Australian men hear,

> You have a viable economy and life because you‚Äôre white and you have sun there. You couldn‚Äôt defend it against Asian men.

> It‚Äôs ok, we know Australians, mate

...

> You‚Äôre a drug addicted loser from a shit family. Yes a male role model is required. You didn‚Äôt have one and you‚Äôre a loser drug addict drop out‚Ä¶ case and point

...

> Bro, we were talking about bloodlines and NOW it‚Äôs pathetic. Yeah. Our families here saw you were pathetic. Saw you couldn‚Äôt stand against regional neighbors

> Your men forebears (remember those, and how important) fucking FAILED on their own merits.

> So if my dad matters‚Ä¶..but your entire male bloodline doesn‚Äôt‚Ä¶..

> Might just show your entire sentiments are that of a bitch, you know?

...

> It‚Äôs ok mate, it‚Äôs clear you guys culturally have a ‚Äúlittle D we couldn‚Äôt save ourselves‚Äù energy that you now have to bring up fads about because your forebears just weren‚Äôt man enough to stop Japanese guys.

> You also come from people largely that were degenerates and undesirables. You also had piss poor performance compared to real men like Philponos.

> I get it, your whole culture is one of defeated cuck-ism that you outwardly express as ‚ÄúI‚Äôm tough.‚Äù

> Dads indeed.

...

> Weird thing to say. Your genetic pool is drug addict losers‚Ä¶ where‚Äôs your mother? Still on the pipe too? Trying to claim some type of authority or superiority because of a war you were never in?? Pure illiterate teenage drop out stupidity

...

> Men don‚Äôt base anything on their dads, your insult was that of a loser bitch whose society can‚Äôt even keep itself propped up and safe.

> Neato

...

Eventually they turned to arguing about careers.

> Yeah, I know the successful type of bitch you are. You attack everything because your success isn‚Äôt really success. Your financial freedom is tied to ONE place and one job.

> I can literally go anywhere I want in the world with the skills I have.

> Your dad really locked you into mediocrity and arguing with randos, and that‚Äôs your success?

> Sweet, this dad convo gets better and better. I love when stuck ‚Äúsuccesses‚Äù tell Me how they‚Äôre better people lol

...

> Where did you get that from you dunce? I own a scaffold company‚Ä¶ üòÖ thick ‚Ä¶

[SSRIs are physically addictive just not behaviorally addictive. If you've been taking SSRIs for a long amount of time and abruptly stop them, you will experience withdrawal effects.](https://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/1ipv2pj/rfk_jr_lays_out_beginning_plans_for_banning/mcvftas/)
>I mean if my dad stops taking his blood thinners he dies, is that addiction?
>>""is that addiction?"" No, it's dependence
>>>That‚Äôs not what dependence is. Dependence is like when you take a steroid for long durations and have to be tapered off because your body has adjusted to them being used, and will need time to resume normal function. Stopping anticoagulants or anti platelets doesn‚Äôt cause withdrawal symptom, but what they were treating/preventing now can kill you, like a stroke in a fib or MI in those with ASCVD.

>... okay? Your point is?
>>I recommend reading the article to find out.
>>>When government researchers follow Kennedy‚Äôs orders to study SSRIs, they‚Äôll find reams of research, including long-term studies, that have found that the drugs are safe and non-addictive.  From the article

[Although it‚Äôs true that many mental health medications are overprescribed (evidence show that people in long term use of antidepressants or anxiolytics improve less than people who stop taking them after stabilizing and use other non-drug alternatives, for example), one cannot just forbid them and expect people to just go cold turkey. That would be totally irresponsible. They are still our first line of defense for acute cases and some of them require months to taper off due to extreme withdrawal symptoms (like benzodiazepines). And, some people might still really need some of these drugs for life (schizophrenics, for example).](https://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/1ipv2pj/rfk_jr_lays_out_beginning_plans_for_banning/mcvt1q3/)

The list of mass shootings, and the link between psychiatric drugs and violence goes on and on. In fact, the common denominator in these  shootings is that the shooter 9 out of 10 times is on a psychiatric drug with violent side effects. We strongly urge you to look at the data, stop turning a blind eye to this obvious link between psychiatric drugs and mass murders.The list:  https://www.cga.ct.gov/asaferconnecticut/tmy/0129/Sheila%20Matthews%20-%20Cofounder%20of%20Ablechild.pdf](https://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/1ipv2pj/rfk_jr_lays_out_beginning_plans_for_banning/mcx75oz/)

1iqbe86,subredditdrama,"""God's honest truth, I don't care what the Pope thinks"", a schism erupts in r/Catholicism after the Pope issues a statement calling for compassion for immigrants","After Trump's inauguration to the presidency on January 20th, Trump has swiftly taken a variety of actions (many of which are commonly seen as cruel) against immigrants. 

In response to these actions, on February 11th, the Pope wrote a letter directed to United States Bishops exhorting them to have compassion for immigrants and to avoid ""unnecessary suffering to our migrant and refugee brothers and sisters"".

This letter was quickly posted to the Catholicism subreddit, where a variety of conservative posters were very unhappy with the Pope's statements.

1ip8h8b,subredditdrama,"Operation Sins of the Mother - Swifties and Chief's fans for the past few days have been review bombing the restaurant of CJ Gardner'-Johnson's mom and calling the ICE tip line to try to get the mom and employees deported. War between swifties and r/Fauxmoi , r/eagles, r/travisandtaylor.","Hello, you may know me from the Cuck Chronicles, TikTok Drama, etc. Today I will write a relatively short post on the recent Taylor Swift Superbowl Drama that has been blown up, its not as entertaining as my prior post, but its entertaining enough that I will write about it

---------------------------------

Context - A few days ago, The Eagles beat the KC Chiefs in the Superbowl. Taylor Swift and the President supported the KC Chiefs (more on how the president matters tangentially in this). Taylor because her boyfriend is in the Chiefs. The loss was pretty large margin wise, with Chief fans leaving early, such as the President.

Swifties, are known as a very very very rabid fanbase on par with Kpop fans and gacha fans.

They then started by review bombing the restaurant of one of the Eagles player's MOM's restaurants in Florida. Then they got a littttttle more unhinged and racist as over the course of a few hours they started calling the ICE tipline and then leaving racist remarks on his mom and family. 

The story, as of now has hit international news, but it started on X and Reddit swift fan groups and these posts are BEFORE it reached international news.

CJGJ is a KNOWN shit-talker. One of his selling points is his ability to get in other players' heads and often draw a punch that will get them ejected. Anyone who watches the NFL knows this and knows to ignore him because he's an asshole. 

They're literally falling for his bullshit, they look ridiculous for doing it, and they're causing a Streisand effect because no one pays attention to CJ's trash talk.

> I made a dark prediction when Taylor endorsed Kamala saying that:

""If Donald Trump wins, as she directly benefits financially, she will make no more than 3 public statements from the election night to when he's sworn in. Her support will start and end tonight.""

She has yet to make any public statements on trump since election night. She only cares for the bottom line, she does not give a shit about women's right, about Gaza, queer people, POC's, ethics, basically human kindness.

She only cares about herself

She was celebrating the Eagles‚Äô win and posted some pictures, hence this dude‚Äôs Instagram post saying Travis should‚Äôve stayed with her and of course being a disgusting misogynist commenting on her body.

So logically Taylor‚Äôs fans should call ICE on his mother‚Äôs employees and ruin her livelihood‚Ä¶ in the name of feminism.

**Mod Pinned Post**

https://www.reddit.com/r/travisandtaylor/comments/1in2xrz/today_in_women_supporting_women_swifties_have/mc7jixf/

> Full context: Eagles player CJ Gardner-Johnson made a post about Kayla, Travis' ex, on social media. Here's our discussion of that post.

Instead of trying to hold him accountable, Swifties have instead decided to go after his mother, once again showing their fundamental misunderstanding of feminism by punishing a woman for the misdeeds of a man. This is not a one-off incident but part of a worrying trend by Swifties who prize traditionalism over independence. Just look at the amount of people who fantasize about ""end game"" being marriage and a child.

The sickening new development is that Swifties (who are an overwhelmingly hwite fanbase) are weaponizing ICE and the threat of ICE against successful women of color.

Sexism and racism is RAMPANT among Swifties, and the few sane voices among them simply don't do enough to call it out. A good part of why this sub even exists is to call out this hateful behavior because Taylor Swift fans simply aren't brave enough to face their peers.

EDIT: Do NOT leave reviews, downvote reviews, or argue with Swifties in other spaces. No brigading means no brigading. If we find out you have been touching the poo, you will be banned

EDIT: The Swifties have arrived to defend mother! Can you please go call out your insane siblings instead? Locked because Swifties see a problem and say ""Yes, let me prove the haters right!""

Replies to pinned post

> I‚Äôll say it again. This is Taylor‚Äôs cult. She formed them, cultivated them, nourished them and has weaponized them. Many are behaving like a domestic terrorist social media group. They form attack groups and summon others with a list of #names then those people do the same until there is an army of attackers. It‚Äôs way past time for sites to block these psychopaths.

> Swifties are stuck at the mental development stage of a toddler.

They believe that Eagles fans, from Philadelphia, a city that elected a black female Democrat as mayor and voted overwhelmingly for Harris, booed Taylor Swift because Eagles fans are MAGA.

It is genuinely mind-boggling that Swifties see MAGA behavior in anyone who dislikes Taylor Swift, but they ignore the proud racists in their own fan base. It's giving Salem witch trial: white women colluding to throw their enemies under the bus while claiming victim status.

But some of the more insane ones would go to jail for her (or at least brag they would) and that's even more crazy. Going to jail for protecting a loved one or a friend no big deal. Going because you bullied and harassed the mom of an ex of some tone deaf pop singer who couldn't pick you out of a lineup is psychotic.

> I'd be surprised if she did. They've done so much to so many people and she's not made a peep. She's aware that her fans would go to extreme lengths in the name of ""defending"" her, but she does not care. I'll bet all the money I don't have that she's happy she has an army that'll go to war for her, not that their behavior could have any impact on people's lives. I'd also wager it hasn't gotten bad enough for her brand because she's so accustomed to making herself the victim that even her fans do it for her. The media even plays into this.

> She should absolutely denounce it, but I don‚Äôt think she will either. I think she gets a thrill from it. I get the feeling it‚Äôs like having her own mercenaries at her disposal who will preemptively attack others in her name, and I doubt she would do a thing to change that.

1ioot62,subredditdrama,Things get meta in /r/Mountaineering when a post about climbing story disputes leads to...climbing story disputes,"Background: in 1996, a huge blizzard hit Mt Everest during the peak of the climbing season, resulting in the deaths of 12 climbers (more [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996_Mount_Everest_disaster)). Among the climbers who survived was writer Jon Krakauer, who was there on assignment *Outside* magazine to write an article about commercial climbing on the mountain, which he then adapted into the best-selling book *Into Thin Air.* However, a number of people, including other climbers who were there, disagreed with his depiction of events, some writing their own books or articles about their perspective.

Currently, Krakauer is now involved in an online fight with a Youtuber named Michael Tracy about what actually happened on Everest in 96. Here's an outside view of that drama from [Outside](https://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-adventure/everest/jon-krakauer-everest-youtube/).

On to the Subreddit Drama:  
The first of the blog posts written by Krakauer was posted to the Mountaineering subreddit, reigniting the  discussion and debate about what happened, who was at fault, what did Krakauer actually say in his work, etc. [Enter our protagonist](https://www.reddit.com/r/Mountaineering/comments/1inv4c4/comment/mcgnpim/?context=29031):

>I mostly don't like the book's suggestion that it was mostly AB's fault for the disaster. This perceived faulting of a man caused him to write his own book.

>I just became a victim myself of someone on here making stuff up about my own climb when they were not there or not even set a single foot on the mountain.

>Controversy will always be there.

However, another commenter takes umbrage with this:

>Tom Kitta, no-one has made anything up about your own climb. On the contrary, you've misrepresented your own climbing accomplishments time and time again...

>You love to say on here that you've ""climbed Broad Peak solo""... What you fail to mention is that you did not summit, you used fixed ropes that you paid for, and then you trashed the rope-fixing team(that you paid a measly $200) to the media... I have linked below proof of you complaining about the rope-fixing team... If you pay a rope fixing team $200 to fix ropes, and then fail to summit because you say they didn't fix the ropes fast enough STOP CLAIMING YOU SOLO CLIMBED BROAD PEAK... You relied on an entire team of rope-fixers the entire way up... THATS NOT A SOLO CLIMB... you literally couldn't summit because the team you relied on didn't fix ropes above 7600M... How could you possibly call that a ""solo""????

>No-one is ""making stuff up"" about your climb by pointing out that you routinely brag about climbing a peak solo when in reality you were fully dependent on the rope fixing team that you barely paid. Additionally, I wouldn't ever criticize soon for failing to summit a peak but you CONSTANTLY demean others here with your whole ""well what have you climbed"" attitude... You literally do it in the comment I'm responding to here

>""they were not there or not even set a single foot on the mountain"" --- Anyone who scrolls through your history in this sub will find you CONSTANTLY demeaning other people for being ""armchair mountaineers"", claiming you're ""a real mountaineer not a poser"", and you're response to every single person who disagrees with you is to baselessly claim that they've never climbed anything and you have so they can't speak on the subject in question...

Weibo - I use weibo and searched for the game and noted some good drama comments and reactions

Facebook - Surprisingly big FB Presence.

FB apology from dev - https://www.facebook.com/story.php?id=100063627824546&story_fbid=975498621247723&_rdr

I put all of my sources I can link here now, but skip as I will concisely explain below.



----------------------------------

Dictionary (due to popular request) - Ignore if you are familiar with the terms already.

NTR - Netorare- A genre of porn in Japan made popular/known in the west. Typically cuck adjacent. It means porn where your self insert watches their love one get dominated. This could be your mom, sister, gf, love interest, etc. It means alot of things, but typically a strong built man, fat bastard, or anyone fucks your loved one and dominates them consensually or non consensually. Most of it is rape/mindbreak

Mindbreak - A person gets fucked so hard, their mind... breaks. A common theme in hentai/porn gachas, and storyplots. A typical strong and confident girl.. or guy, gets raped so hard they are a shadow of their former self and addicted.

Gacha -refers to Gachapon games, where you gamble real life money for units/weapons, etc. Most of the time it is a girl.

------------------------


Context

 Gacha games are usually F2P live service video games, typically mobile with some PC versions where you ""pull"" or roll for characters like you would a slot machine. Costs can very from 50 cent a ""pull"" to 5$ a pull for some of the spendy gachas. Typically you pull for ""waifus"" or girl characters in the popular gachas, some games have transitioned as they found people would usually only pull for female characters. Then some added romance.

-------------------------------

**Beginning START HERE if you are familiar with my previous posts**

Orisries was a newly released gacha PORN game where it skips the fanservice and goes full nsfw and lets you fuck your units with a storyline and all of that. What differentiates it from other H-Gachas (Hentai Gachas) is that it is a AAA hentai game company making it with tons of experience in the field with other successful games, hentai, etc under their belt. The hype for this game among the porn addicted anime fans in the west and east was large (for a game of its type). The H-Gacha genre is small compared to normal gachas. HOWEVER, H-Gacha gamers spend several times more than normal gacha players and some of the most popular H-Gacha games earn millions from a few of its players a month. A popular one to note is https://store.steampowered.com/app/2808930/Lust_Goddess/ Lust goddess, another H-Gacha for comparison which tops the steam charts frequently. Point being, H-Gachas make bank from dedicated fans. For Normal gacha players, some H-Gachas can charge as much as 50$ per 10 pull. Yes, you heard me right, 50$ for a limited SSR 10 pull. The reason for the higher value from a typical H-gamer response is that they provide more ""value"" and ""content"" than normal gacha games with full hentai clips, storylines, and you get to fuck the unit obviously. You can go on dates with them, be a part of their storyline as their lover (they all have plot surprisingly no different than normal gacha games and unrelated to porn most of the time) with some even having employees real time chat with you as the character for the top spenders. Meaning you can chat with your Girl in game in real time and a dedicated employee will roleplay as that girl with chat history saved and everything. Some games even advertise that the writer themself will do it for the top .1%. Other parasocial features include marketing campaigns to send you panties and other clothing items from your designated girl.

----------------

**Break** - You will need time to recover from what I just written, so take this moment to take a deep breath

-----------------------

Orisrises, as we've now established has a big potential fanbase with over 10,000 players in a CLOSED BETA TEST causing a server crash on day 1. It was so big in comparison to other H-Gachas, they had to purchase ANOTHER server and relaunch.

Trailer -https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92PGJf_6T_o

Gameplay vid - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gUfHE2Cw88

In China/KR vids hit the 6 and low 7 digit marks on their respective platforms. Gaining exposures to millions.

In the west it hit the low 5 digits, but, in the East it had the potential to be one of the biggest H-Gachas in history.

Another selling point was that this H-Gacha is not a men only gacha, but also services female players too as the company makes porn for females and porn for men. They marketed the idea that its a game you can play with your girlfriend and bond over and that the game is not segregated. 

The however, is PvP focused with some PvE content featuring army battles. However, you get resources from? Sex. You fuck your units to lvl them up and get currency to buy weapons. You can buy gifts from the store to give to your units to raise their affection so they fuck you so you can get resources to lvl them up and buy weapons leading to more sex scenes. So the gameplay loop could be

Spend IRL Money for gifts -> Use gifts to raise affection -> Fuck the unit -> Get cumpoints (its not what they are called, but I digress) -> Use cumpoints to lvl them up, making them fuck you more for more cumpoints -> Repeat until out of cumpoints forcing you to spend more money. You can also raise affection by doing story content AND

PVP - If you win a PvP match against another player, you can FREELY R*pe their units (I'm typing it like to avoid the automod). Meaning you can lvl up your units for free this way and its the main gameplay loop, play pvp matches, fuck the opponent's girls and lvl up.

Now, I'll give you a second to think of the flaw

-------------------------

**The Flaw** - The game was marketed towards men, but has male characters to entice female players too. Men, in general don't want to see their units ravaged by the opponent when they lose.

Players, hating the idea of their girls getting bukake when they lose, started using only male units. When you win you HAD to sex the opponent's units. 

**The Gay Porn Era** - This resulted in a constant loop of players gradually switching all of their units to male, everyone is now watching gay porn. You cannot released your captured units without fucking them. So in order to lvl up, you must capture the opponent's units, since they are all dudes now, you can opt to NOT capture them when you win as typically they expect an army to be filled with a mix of girl/guy characters so the opponent can choose whatever unit they want to capture post battle to enjoy the scene with. IF EVERYONE of you unit is a dude, your opponent has to fuck a dude if he wins. If he doesn't capture any units, you don't lose anything. So the end result was the community picking the units who are the worse to r*pe with the most unappealing scenes. 

The game over the course of weeks became a full fledged gay game unintentionally with some comments on gachagaming and Orisries decrying this as well as FB, Weibo, etc

Reply 

> Actually, both in all likelihood. If you send your girls you get NTR'd, while you are forced to have gay sex because nobody else is willing to do that.

> it's like a shitty prisoner dillemma. if everyone ""cooperates"" then at least it's the ""best"" outcome. But because everyone ""betrays"", you are stuck with this. if you ""cooperates"" while other ""betrays"" then you get the worst outcome

> it's a pick your poison situation. There is no good outcome here, only from bad to worse.

> Think of it this way; if I send out my 5* waifu, and you beat em, then you get to see hentai with them. And I like my waifu so I dont wanna do that. Instead I send out my weaker 4* male and you will probably beat em. But now you also HAVE TO watch em hentai cuz that gives you resources... So... who really wins here ?


> Nah it's a taiwanese game so I assume the playerbase is mostly chinese.
Chinese ppl playing gacha have this weird ntr mentality where they go batshit insane if there's a dialogue line implying their waifu is engaged married or sth, so I can imagine those brainlets frothing at their mouths thinking about losing a battle and having their ""wives"" ntr'd.
So they just send dudes to get seggs'd instead so they won't feel ntr'd

> I don't think that having males units on a sex game catered to men is inherently bad. This reminds me of Millennium War Aegis a TD hentai game were you also had high tier women units and several mid to low tier male units. But whereas raising affection with girls would lead to sex scenes; raising affection with guys would unlock conversations with them explaining their backstory and stuff, essentially you end up becoming bros with them. It was actually the best of both worlds and ironically I ended up caring more for the guys since I knew more of them as characters rather than the women since it was all just sex. This game since like it completely missed the mark tho

> Why you allow me pull Gilliam , I not want roll man, real women only please.

> Typical TW gay man, you harass real china with game and steal money. I want money back as rare gamble means I want rare women, not rare man!!! 

-----------------

**Response and further explanation**

They have gay scenes and straight scenes, since it is AAA, they have ALOT of animations and If any player had female units and won over male units it will play femme dommy scenes. Whoever wins is the dommy. However, against people don't want their girls to fuck the ENEMY regardless of if its pegging or not. 

The CEO of the company went on FB and apologized

https://www.facebook.com/story.php?id=100063627824546&story_fbid=975498621247723&_rdr

https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fery3dcr9n27d1.jpeg%3Fwidth%3D993%26format%3Dpjpg%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D7d373aa3d3893c7ff1ed2a5220b5ee41c3ed5553

Apology is very long and they personally emailed the most HC fans of this new game (meaning high spenders) and offered to chat 1-1 with them on what they want. 

One critique common among CN players is that Taiwan is doing all of this gay stuff to force Western Imperialism on Chinese citizens and cites that this was all intentional. They also noted that their other games include gay porn as well and they had a gay agenda/Western agenda to manipulate China for the West.

The CEO noted this in the apology and assures it is due to their art team and developers also working on New World Canivale and Project XXL which are female oriented porn games that they were ""too receptive"" of male characters now and were a bit off in the basis of ""ordinary men"" and assures they are trying to adjust it. Meaning they been drawing too much gay porn that the amount in this new game which is considerably less is still too much for normal ppl. He also noted that it was never their intention to disgust players and that their team was ""too accepting of gender issues"" and thought it would not be a big deal.

-----------------------------------


**Beginning Aftermath**

As the r/gachagaming post about the original drama blew up, the game started attracting Gay gamers from the West and furries, alot of furries. The game slowly began to actually became a gay game in playerbase as more and more gays were joining. The company, being again Taiwanese and CN/East Asia focus, DID NOT WANT THIS despite the money of these gays.

Comments during this time were posted on weibo and kakao and were hating on the Western gays. Why did they know this?

After a PvP match you can friend your opponent like any other game. typically you do so to BM them.

However, they noticed that when a Western Player name won or lost and they friend BM them, the western gay/furries liked it and started sending them gay/furry porn. Then the gay/furry H-Gacha gamer community (WHICH EXISTS SOMEHOW) started organizing on 4-Chan and 8-chan to fight back against China cause reasons? Anyway, actual gays were friend requesting and using ChatGPT and AI to translate their gay fanfictions on how they just dominated and NTR/Cucked the other player's male units when they won. Which is a new thing for CN players as typically the LOSER does it by sending them message HAHA you won, enjoy fucking dudes. Now that this new Gay/Furry Western playerbase actually LIKED the gay scenes when they won, Chinese players were double humilated. The WINNER now has the high of winning the match AND fucking your units, whereas before the consolation prize was knowing your opponent has to fuck dudes. Now the loser knows the winner is enjoying their men and worse, they were sending them DMs on how they were enjoying it and some went as far as to saying you're next. In addition, the furries were especially ruthless as they included furry fanfics in their dms on how their big animal cocks were enjoying the dudes, which weirded out and angered CN players even more than usual.

The CEO had to respond and he did, they REMOVED the gay parts alot of it from the gay and ignored the gay playerbase they unintentionally fostered in the West. This decimated the Gay community. He also apologized and started restricting western to CN friend request and Dms. The game also updated to include more censored words the CN community learned from the furry community.

Revenue dropped in the West, but in the East it slowly came back.

There are still gay scenes, but much less, only SSRs have them now if you pull for SSRs to compensate the few female/gays. But SRs don't have the gay. Most of the offensive scenes were removed. 

I should note, pre patch, the gay scenes went HARD according to sources hence why the gay community all flocked to the game. Those scenes are all gone as it was too much for CN players. It was legit too gay.

1inm3wh,subredditdrama,"Another Day, Another Controversy in r/limbuscompany (NSFW version, or lack thereof)","This is my first post here so please excuse any rough edges. Things also might be missing because the situation is still developing.

**Background**: Limbus Company is a South Korean gacha game created by Project Moon (PM), an indie dev with a sizable cult following. Anyone familiar with gacha games might have heard of some drama and controversies involving this game, most notably was when South Korean incels caused a female artist to resign from her position with PM. The mods of r/limbuscompany did a decent job at holding the community together throughout all the various...incidents that the game and devs have gone through, but users believe that they have finally lost it.

**The Incident**:

[The modpost to discuss the future of NSFW](https://www.reddit.com/r/limbuscompany/comments/1idb37i/modpost_lets_talk_about_nsfw/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

With the release of two rather [sensual(?) pair of characters](https://www.reddit.com/r/limbuscompany/comments/1igll8a/kurokumo_clan_captain_ishmael_000_kurokumo/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), mods started re-examining their policy on submissions in the sub (both posts and comments), specifically ones that veer closer to the NSFW side of things. It's important to note here that there exists a Limbus Company shitposting sub, r/TheOdysseyHadAPurpose, where rules are more lax and NSFW is allowed and even encouraged. There is also an overlap of mods between the two subs. To make a long story short, mods of r/limbuscompany held a weeklong-poll on the future of NSFW in the sub as well as to allow users to voice their concerns. The majority of the votes went to ""No Change"". The poll also mentioned that the top choice will not necessarily be followed. This will become relevant in a little bit.

**The Result:**

[Hark! NSFW shall be restricted](https://www.reddit.com/r/limbuscompany/comments/1im03ao/modpost_rlimbuscompany_nsfw_rule_changes/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) (sitting at 0 karma, 959 comments at time of writing)

Mods have decided via modpost to restrict NSFW submissions after the polling period has ended. The sub will now be in a trial period while the new rules are rolled out, another modpost will be made in one month to discuss the matter. Users were not pleased.

Many users have noticed that the NSFW changes were made despite the results of the poll:

And of course, the drama spreads into the sub.

By the way, you might notice some re-occuring characters as you browse this sub for more drama. It's not relevant to the drama, but keep it in mind for an enhanced reading experience.

**The Fallout**:

Like every time these sorts of decisions happen, members post about it. Here are some choice threads with quotes.

As mentioned above, this is a developing situation so things could rapidly change from what I have written.

TLDR: mods considered changing subreddit's NSFW policy, leaning on stricter due to influx of modmail. Mods held a poll to gauge members' opinions. Most members decided on ""No Change"". Mods pushed out stricter NSFW policy. Users react.

Last minute update: the mod who made the initial modposts (TheBagleBearer) appears to be suspended. I could not find them on the modlist either. I'm not really sure what happened as this has just occurred.

[No word about the fact african tribes enslaved and sold Africans to the white people?](https://www.reddit.com/r/OptimistsUnite/comments/1ilxtl7/kendrick_confused_maga_with_black_beauty/mbyw3c9/)
>Talk about a bad faith argument.  What's your point? (OP)
>>That it's not about race, because black people started the whole thing by capturing their black enemies and selling them.
>>>I mean, if that's our justification to help you sleep at night, then do you.  I came to celebrate blackness. Not sure why you here to talk about how your ancestors were slaves traders. (OP)
>>>>""celebrate blackness"" ...why? How does being black influence the kind of person you are?

[Africans sold Africans into slavery, and they were selling them to middle eastern people for thousands of years before Europeans arrived.](https://www.reddit.com/r/OptimistsUnite/comments/1ilxtl7/kendrick_confused_maga_with_black_beauty/mbyvelq/)
>Europeans slaughtered other Europeans throughout their history. Those facts add nothing to this topic.
>>It rebukes the idea that slavery was a racist practice. It had nothing to do with race or ethnicity.
>>>So the view that black slaves were 'animals' or 'subhuman', human chattel to be bought and sold like property, wasn't a racist endeavour?
>>>>Quite literally every race was a slave at one point or another. But y'all ignore that part
>>>>>No race has done it like yall white people though. Whites came to america, killed native americans who were here first then claimed the land as ‚Äútheir own‚Äù. Helped kidnap blacks from africa to use them as their own personal workforce. Treated slaves HORRIBLE and in some cases even tortured them. Whites also tried to enforce their religious beliefs and customs on multiple cultures they deemed ‚Äúinferior‚Äù to them like the french trying to colonize the vietnamese who never asked for it. Yall whites like to ignore that part thoughü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

[The majority of African slaves during the transatlantic slave trade came from the West Coast of Africa, specifically regions like present-day Senegal, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, and West Central Africa including Angola, Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo, and Gabon; with the majority of slaves being captured and sold by other Africans to European traders.   They weren't stolen . They were sold. What this means, is that evil comes in all forms, and it is not relagated to one color of skin. Your own people sold you out. It's not because ""the white man stole you"" . It's because some evil Europeans, met some evil Africans , and the rest is history, but it pains me how so many of you don't even know what actually happened and how ignorant you are.](https://www.reddit.com/r/OptimistsUnite/comments/1ilxtl7/kendrick_confused_maga_with_black_beauty/mbywa63/)
>It kills me how many people don't know this. White people didn't go raiding African villages. Africans raided other African villages and then sold them to white people...really any people that would buy them. And no one actually cares about slavery. not to the extent it doesn't benefit them otherwise they wouldn't be rocking their slave made shien and temu clothes and talking trash on their iphones. China uses the fuck out of some slaves and no one says shit about it.
>>‚ÄúThey were selling them, so it wasn‚Äôt wrong for Americans to buy them‚Äù is certainly a choice.
>>>No that's not what I'm saying. What I'm saying is that everyone blames the white people. yeah they fucked up and did wrong. But no one ever says shit about the other black people who did the actual pillaging and capture. Slavery was a common practice back then. Was it right? Hell no. Is it one specific race's fault. Also no. It wasn't just the Americans everyone was in on it the whole world was in on it.
>>>>The US fought a literal civil war because part of the country demanded that they be allowed to continue owning other human beings as property in perpetuity. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just white people‚Äôs fault‚Äù is suuuuch a facile and meaningless distinction to attempt to draw.

>God, I wasn‚Äôt even aware of just how racist the right wing retorts got until I decided to sort this thread by controversial.
>>They even use the same textbook response. And that response is so trashy as well, like how does it justify slavery if someone else captured people?? They still bought them by tens of thousands and brought them to the land of ""freedom"".
>>>It doesn't justify it, but OP is rewriting history to suit a narrative. Slavery was the model of the entire world. It was heinous, and that was no exception in the U.S. We bought slaves. Africa sold slaves. The difference is that the U.S is one of the only places where millions died to abolish it in the bloodiest U.S conflict ever. 
>>>>I'm actually laughing right now, ahaha. Thanks for the joke. Your bloodiest US conflict is a speck of dust on what africans has endured. Millions died to abolish it? USA is the only country where they needed war to change it. Continue living in your US bubble, little man. One day it will burst and you will have nothing left.

>Pretzel logic. Move along (OP)
>>You deny that your black ancestors rounded up and sold each other to the highest bidder, some of which were white Americans? Don't forget to mention who your ancestors also were, since you love to use words like ""we"" and ""us"" when you refer to slaves who died many years before you existed.  Morality has nothing to do with race. Only racists believe that.
>>>Where did I deny that some black people sold slaves?  I guess you are sayign so to absolve your ancestors. But they are both wrong.  You seem to think that slavery is a thing of the past and so I should not refer to it.

r/Vocaloid is a subreddit for the community of the voice synthesizing software, VOCALOID, made by Yamaha. This is where the well-known virtual idol Hatsune Miku hails from.

# Before the NSFW Rule Change

r/Vocaloid was discussing about the controversy surrounding Hiiragi Magnetite's song ""Zako,"" a song about a child ""bullying"" the listener in a suggestive way using Kaai Yuki (which is voiced by a 9 year old), in which people witch hunted Hiiragi Magnetite to the point of privating the music video and apologizing in public. Said discussions spawned slapfights amongst the community.

Here's some comments and replies under some posts regarding the discussion.

On a minor note, another Vocaloid producer SAWTOWNE removed their video of ""Mimukawa Nice Try,"" which had a similar premise to ""Zako,"" but it's instead voiced by Hatsune Miku. This was posted on r/Vocaloid, and caused a minor version of the controversy surrounding ""Zako.""

# The Change of the NSFW Rule.

A mod of the r/Vocaloid [declared an update to the subreddit's rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vocaloid/comments/1imritm/rule_updates_effective_immediately/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), which say the following:

> ""Notable highlights include:

> Prohibition on all NSFW content. This notably includes songs that deal with sexually suggestive themes, or discussion of said songs.

> New rule on keeping things civil. If you see somebody acting incivil, do not engage, report it.

> Additional rule about staying on topic, and what constitutes on topic. (This can be considered an extension/clarification of the quality content rule.)

> Formal rule against AI content. (This was basically enforced already, but now it is a formal rule.)

> Why these changes?

> Over the last few weeks much of the discourse on this sub has turned nasty and gone off the rails. This is the first step in starting to rein that in.

> The next step will be bringing on additional moderators. There have been several users who have pointed out in modmail or otherwise that most of the moderation team is inactive, and you are not wrong. If you think you might be interested, look for a post in the next few days.

> In the meantime, please continue to report content that breaks the rules, and do not engage with those who are acting incivil.""


# Reactions to the Change


Many users within the r/Vocaloid community were enraged by the announcement of the rule change, most notably at the part where sexually suggestive songs are not allowed, and discussions about them are also included.

There is [a post that says that if the NSFW rules don't change, the OP will make a derivative of the VOCALOID subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vocaloid/comments/1imtowd/if_the_rule_of_nsfw_dont_changes_in_tentated_to/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).

Comments have included the following:

> [be the change you want to see in the world! seriously though, I'd love a community that embraces calm nuanced discussion instead of devolving into a mess of name calling and assumptions.

>> I dont know, unless the subreddit would be strictly nsfw, i feel like that would just devolve into tribalism and cause a huge seperation in the community. The best thing is to wait until the mods revert the rule, or if that doesn't happen create an nsfw dedicated subreddit.

Another post [tested this rule](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vocaloid/comments/1imuz4c/testing_is_deco27_nsfw_enough_to_be_banned/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), to see if a song made by a highly-revered producer that tackles a sexually suggestive subject would get them banned.

Comments have included the following:

> [""The closer the collapse of a server, the crazier its laws are.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vocaloid/comments/1imuz4c/comment/mc5w7r7/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

The majority of the posts, however, have pointed out that a big amount of Vocaloid songs have tackled sexually suggestive topics, pedophilic or not, citing that it's an insult towards Vocaloid producers, and have said that the mods should've banned posts only relating ""Zako,"" and not ban everything else that is NSFW.

The following posts will be mentioned:

1im9ks1,subredditdrama,Crip Walking - Compton dance or a celebration of gang violence? r/gifs debates.,"Kendrick Lamar performed at this year's Super Bowl halftime show, and during ""Not Like Us"", Serena Williams made a surprise guest appearance. For context, Williams dated Drake for a time who went after her during his and Lamar's beef, which ""Not Like Us"" is part of. During her appearance she ""Crip walked"", which is a popular dance that was originally created by the Crips gang in Compton.

This has some people upset because they see performing the dance as a celebration of the Crips, which is especially controversial because Serena's half-sister Yetunde Price was killed by two Crips members in a drive-by. However, others say that the Crip walk is a representation of Compton culture where Serena and Lamar are from, separate from its ties to the gang itself.

These sides came to a clash in r/gifs when someone [posted a gif of Serena doing the dance](https://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/1ilz126/serena_williams_crip_walking/)

Now to the drama:

>[That dance is called the Crip walk. It originally was done to show affiliation with the criminal street gang the Crips which originated in Los Angeles and has since spread across the country.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/1ilz126/serena_williams_crip_walking/mc04lwa/)

>>I think it's important to note that both gangs are different than the Crips and Bloods of the early 90's and before. The Crips formed in 1969 as a response to systemic racism and as a protective group for black communities.

>>>I see we‚Äôre at the making the crips wholesome and it was all the states fault stage now.

>>>>if you're asking why Kendrick or Serena are decked out in blue colors and representing the Crips, it's not because they want to represent thieves and murderers, they want to represent where they grew up.

>>>>>And also represent the gang that killed her sister

>>This is the whitest thing I‚Äôve ever read.

>>>How?

>>>>Because that is not what this moment in the halftime show is about. Imagine the entirety of the Drake/Lamar feud getting pushed to the side to assert that this dance move is a controversial glorification of gang violence.

>>There's only controversy because many American whites don't understand the effect of alienation on American blacks such that group creates culture in the form of music (jazz, rap, hip hop), dance (the crip walk), and language. People like the crip walk because it is good dancing...that's it. The only reason it is connected back to gangs nowadays is because white people can't tease the name from the actual dance.

>> * She‚Äôs not celebrating what killed her sister. The Crip walk, which is the most common name but can really just be called the Walk as well, has turned to becoming a celebration and showing of love for Compton. This is also furthered by the fact that for years upon years now Kendrick has preached for unity between the gangs. It‚Äôs almost a ‚ÄúAround Kendrick, it‚Äôs about love‚Äù.

>>It's about more than just the gangs, it's about representing Los Angeles, and black culture in Los Angeles. Whether it's involving gangs or not, it's a form of expression, it's art

The crip walk is first and foremost associated with a dangerous gang which has killed people in the tens of thousands, possibly even the hundreds of thousands over its time.

1ilt6bt,subredditdrama,"Someone sticks chewing gum in their ears as makeshift earplugs, ends up in the hospital, and asks who they can sue. /r/legaladvicecanada is not impressed","#**The Context:**

A user posts to /r/legaladvicecanada with a story about [how they put chewing gum in their ears](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvicecanada/s/ndb1AUE4a5) as makeshift earplugs at work, got the gum stuck in their ears, had to go to the hospital, and now apparently has tinnitus. OOP wants to know if they can sue either their employer or doctor for damages. 

The post in full is below:

>Complicated situation. I posted earlier as well but I did not include all key details so this time I will.
>
>I started a factory job in November 2024. Remote location.
>
>As a precautionary measure, I always wore my own earmuffs and earplugs every time I worked even though the other employees did not seem to take hearing protection that seriously.
>
>One day I did not have earplugs because my order did not come (postal Strike issues). But I did not want to take the risk of skipping work. So as a makeshift option, I chewed some gum and shoved it into my ears to use as earplugs. It worked really well.
>
>But after 8 hours, the gum went into my ear canal and I had to go to the hospital to get it removed.
>
>After the removal, the doctor noted that I had a lot of earwax. He then made the executive decision to scrape out earwax from my right ear canal without asking me first. He was about to do it to my left ear but I told him to stop.
>
>2 days later, I went to work but I still didn't have earplugs. I only used my earmuffs (which I thought would be enough protection).
>
>About a 1-2 days later, I acquired reactive tinnitus and dysacusis in my right ear (which is also the ear where the doctor scraped earwax from).
>
>I am still unsure how I got tinnitus. One theory is that the noise level at work went above the danger limit and my earmuffs were not enough protection.
>
>Another theory is that the when the doctor scraped out earwax from my ear, he ended up exposing my eardrum to a new raw level of sound which it is not accustomed to after being protected by earwax for years (possibly decades). And so my auditory system could not handle this new level of sound. (Which might explain why the dysacusis is occuring in the right ear but not the left ear).
>
>Because my tinnitus is reactive, I am now  extremely sensitive to sound and I cannot work in any type of noisy environment. My work prospects have become limited.
>
>Can someone please tell me what do so?
>
>I have been advised to file a claim at the workers compensation board, but what if it's not the company's fault? What if it's the doctor who caused this entire situation by meddling with my ear? 
>
>Do I hold the doctor responsible? Who do I report this to?
>
>Now the key issue I missed out last time: shoving chewing gum in your ear cannot cause tinnitus. Tinnitus indicates damage to the inner ear hair cells (which are behind the ear drum) and it usually happens by acoustic shock.

[I searched this subreddit for Project 2025 and read a bunch of threads from last summer full of conservatives saying that it would never happen and that Trump is unfamiliar with it. Now that he has implemented so many things from P25, and appointed authors of the project to cabinet positions, how do you all feel? Do you think that Trump misled voters while campaigning? Do you support project 2025?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1ika81f/left_vs_right_battle_royale_open_thread/mbks35j/)
>You realize Project 2025 is a boogie man liberal media dug up to try and scare you all. Yes, there is some overlap with the ideas proposed by that think tank because they were also Republicans, but Trump has had a well-defined platform, for the most part, throughout his campaign and now he just delivering on campaign promises. Stop falling for branding campaigns to create boogie man by the corrupt legacy media. They're lying to you every which way they can.
>>Russell Vought, a key architect of Project 2025, was confirmed on Thursday as Head of the OMB. He also held this position in Trump's 1st term.  Not sure where you got the idea of Project 2025 being ""boogie man liberal media"" from; it's been intrinsically tied to Trump and the Republican party from the get.
>>>Trump has a clear and transparent platform which he regularly speaks to. The man speaks for hours at rallies laying out his vision for America. Tagging some think tank within his party and branding it as a threat is the work of the liberal media. They are projecting their own nonsense, see Kamala's nonexistent platform, onto a man who has been nothing but sincere with the American people about who he is and what he wants to do.  Not comprehending all of this is why your side lost the election.
>>>>Hypothetically what would have to happen for you to say Project 2025 is happening? I mean like, would Trump have to say the words ""I endorse Project 2025 and am enacting it.""?
>>>>>Yep, that's about it. I trust Trump about a thousand times more than the legacy media whores running around going on about their boogeyman ""pROjeCt 2025"". When I say trust, I don't mean because he is a straightforward guy; but rather that he has put himself out there more than any president I've seen in my lifetime, so you can get a pretty good idea of him if you are paying attention.

1iks7bx,subredditdrama,OP gets obliterated by the /r/SteamDeck community when he shares his custom handheld mount that straps onto and around the airplane passenger seat in front of him.,"# Subreddit background

/r/SteamDeck is a subreddit for content involving the [Steam Deck,](https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck/) which is a $399 USD handheld gaming device (like a Nintendo Switch) that was produced by Valve Corporation, and allows gamers to play games from their Steam library on the go instead of on their desktop. [Steam](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_(service)) is a video game hosting library software client with tens of thousands of games available for free or purchase in the game store.

# OP‚Äôs handmade mount

OP, after deciding they‚Äôd rather use their Steam Deck with a controller rather than as a handheld while flying internationally, created their own strap and mount, and [posted the following](https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/s/TV1vlRLhe4 ) on /r/SteamDeck:

> **They called a madman! Built a simple but reliable airplane Steam Deck Holder.**
> 
> The desk tray is too low and really kills any will I have to watch or play for long flights (This one was from Spain to Japan on AirChina plane, will go to Brazil soon with some slight changes)
> 
> I got some straps that I can put behind the steam deck cover (JSAUX) and put on the chair in front of me being suspended in the head cushions of it.
> 
> I could watch things I downloaded with my noise cancelling headsets or play for prolonged periods of time with a very good posture.
> 
> My friends were cringing when I showed my plan but demonstrated certain surprise (I was hoping for jealous) with how well it worked!
> 
> *[4 images shared show how the mount looks when set up, and also the straps that are used to clip* **around the headrest** *of the front passenger‚Äôs seat. OP is holding a turquoise controller in their left hand (this is important later)]*

# Users react‚Ä¶negatively

[It‚Äôs invading the passenger‚Äôs space:](https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/s/UxropSlZYz)

> You need to use some hooks to keep the assembly on your side of the chair. I would never even think to invade the space of another passenger like that, it‚Äôs unbelievably rude and entitled.

> Yep, I would simply hold the steam deck in my hands ü§∑

> What? Hold the Steam Deck in your hands?

> In this economy seat?

[Do the straps actually interfere?](https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/s/pbHEcRygSe)

> OP: No, because international flights have a head cushion which you can regulate de height. And the strap sits in between the head cushion and chair, it gets hanging in a metal tray, the person can still put it higher or lower if they want, you just need to tight or loose a little later. I wouldnt do it on chairs without that head cushion. *[downvoted]*

> Shouldn‚Äôt do it if any person is in the seat in front of you regardless of if you think it‚Äôs in their way or not. Just common courtesy and the world would be so much better if more people used it.

> If you didn't pay for the seat don't mess with it.

> still got the audacity to double down and school other people about flights like we‚Äôve never seen a fucking plane interior üòÇ

> Why is he being down voted? It goes behind the headrest *[downvoted]*

> Because it would still create pressure that could be felt through the headrest, which would make the seat in front less comfortable than if the strap wasn't there.
> 
> AND, it's not your fucking personal space. It's their seat, they paid for it, don't fucking mess with it.

[OP then posts a comment with an image of the passenger seat design for the flight:](https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/s/BxcYnUdAKA)

> In reponse of the posts mentioning how this bothers the person in front of you, here is a picture how the seats in an Airbus A380 looks like. It goes in between the head cushion and the chair and dont even hang go that low because it gets in a diagonal arc from front to back. *[massively downvoted]*
> 
> *[Image of seats on the right side of the airplane, picture taken while standing in the aisle]*

> ""I was hoping for jealous"" this guy is a Main character

> Still a big no, dude. It's hard enough to have some personal space in a plane, much less have a fellow passenger's doodads clipped to your headrest.
> 
> If you really, really must, maybe get them something for the trouble? Don't assume they're okay with it just because you asked (for sure you won't!). Or buy their plane seat outright.

> If it was attached to my seat, that I paid for, you can bet those buckles are getting unclipped about 0.5s into the flight.

> He‚Äôs rolling through comments, posting this pic like 30 times, digging deeper and blaming ignorant Americans for not ‚Äúgetting it‚Äù

> Exactly. Buckles or not, if that thing flies around and bonks me on the head during turbulence, I'll grab it and throw it in the nearest bin. They're not paying for my seat, and sure as hell their insurance won't be paying for my possible concussion.

> You read about that Dad who just threw a flaming laptop out the emergency exit of a plane? Yeah that's me with that steam deck. Idgaf.

[Redditors have a boner for drama:](https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/s/4qtAJ8I7tw)

> Is it just the inherent anti social nature of us redditors that assume that OP would force this onto a passenger and not assume, I don‚Äôt know, that he would just ask if he could affix the device? Using words and such?
> 
> And fwiw I fly this cabin configuration enough and the way the straps would affix would not be felt at all by the person up front‚Ä¶when my knee was injured I had to grab between that area to get out of my seat‚Ä¶particularly if the person in front of me was reclined. It wasn‚Äôt like I was touching their head.
> 
> Yall just so horny for some kind of invasion of personal space drama. We‚Äôre taking our collective rage at air travel in general out on OP lol.
> 
> Now downvote me, boners *[70 downvotes]*

> There are tons of people out there that have issues saying no, do you see how this would be a problem?

> Well if they don't like something, they should learn to say no. *[downvoted]*

> I agree but you don't see the issue of intruding into someone's space?

> If they are chill with it it's fine. If not then obviously don't do it. *[downvoted]*

> Guys again, a lot of people out there have trouble saying no in public situations. My partner is a timid small person and is one of those people. Maybe they say yes and you think it's chill but they're not actually cool with it. My last message on this, ain't gonna argue anymore.

> Sad that you have to explain consent to dumb apes today. But thank you for your effort. I have difficulty saying no at times due to stuff from growing up.

[OP shares a pic of how low the Steam Deck is when placed on the foldout tray:](https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/s/VELkQz8gYi)

> OP: And this is an example of how low in comparison it is on the desk tray in a 12 hours long flight. Even if using hands, its heavy after a while and needs to fight for the arm rest with the people around you. *[downvoted]*

> ""Wow this is really inconvenient. I should put that inconvenience on to someone else.""
> 
> Dude, no one is supporting you on what you did. It was an asshole move. Just accept that and don't do it again. Defending makes you look like an unempathetic douche who can't even remotely understand how it could bother someone's personal space.

# OP makes a new post

2 days later, [OP makes an update post,](https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/s/GUXl5CoQ93) which is *10 paragraphs long,* along with a video showing the custom mount, so here‚Äôs just a snippet of it:

> **Update on the Madness. Steam Deck straps with context.**

> ‚Ä¶Such a weird take that some people here have that ‚ÄúI PAID FOR IT‚Äù or ‚ÄúMY SPACE/PRIVACY‚Äù when in reality everyone paid to be there and it doesnt cost much to try to be healpful and make other peoples flight good too.
> 
> Some critics were so hostile and unfounded, not that some randoms opinions on the internet affect me, fuck them, but trying to make sense of it to try to understand the point to give a counter argument is so hard! People give such weird responses that you start to live in the world they paint.
> 
> I got tired after some 2 hours on hand. Trays are usually too low to use it for long periods as it strains my neck. I dont need more than this to be entitled to not hold it in my hands.
> 
> There is a weird gate keeping in here that I wasnt expecting. I was wondering if I should post again in here due to such a hostile group but you know what? Because I know it bothers them, I will use it even more wrong now (steam deck as a car GPS incoming).

# Users don‚Äôt feel sympathy

[OP does care about criticism:](https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/s/dt0ZxRJCGb)

> ‚Äúnot that some randoms opinions on the internet affect me, fuck them‚Äù¬†
> 
> Proceeds to write an essay justifying their contraption.¬†

> OP: I was referring to the aggressive kind of comments and that came from a very wrong assumption, like the ones ‚ÄúKill yourself‚Äù I received on private msgs. The rest of the people that had reasonable criticism I felt compelled to give an update and that it isnt as bad as they thought it was. But those aggressive kinda represent half of the sub for what I thought on previous post regardless, so the critic for the sub also looked a little necessary. *[mega downvoted]*

> My brother in Christ please just take the L and move on with your life

> If you put that stupid strap shit on my headrest on a seat THAT I PAID FOR, I would tell you to kill yourself too, while I piss on that Steamdeck.

> OP: It wasnt you. Was it? So whats the point of this comment? xD so lonely? *[downvoted]*

[OP says users should move on:](https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/s/a4Chv4pujZ)

> OP: Sorry if you think it wasnt necessary, just move on the next post. *[more downvotes]*

> I did, that was the last post. Then you made another post longer in every way.

> bro got so mad he made two replies to gather more downvotes

[OP needs to move on:](https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/s/4hGPNy1pqV)

> Dude just accept the embarrassment.

> Careful, next we‚Äôll get a 10 page post and 12 minute video about how we‚Äôre all wrong

> Final video: 12 hours of OP tapping on everyone‚Äôs shoulder seated near him every 5 minutes going ‚Äúyou still good with my steam deck?‚Äù.

> Probably not far off. OP said it himself:
> 
> *‚ÄúI was wondering if I should post again in here due to such a hostile group but you know what? Because I know it bothers them, I will use it even more wrong now (steam deck as a car GPS incoming).‚Äù*
> 
> Loves the attention.

> I feel like he‚Äôs crying through a smiling mask. When people get really butthurt about stuff like this they‚Äôll do everything in their power to prove that they were right, despite them making an ass out of themselves lol.

# Users make memes to dunk on OP more

The users in the subreddit decided to dunk on OP‚Äôs contraption even more by making memes about it and photoshopping OP‚Äôs left hand holding the turquoise controller within the meme.

Lastly, [a user makes a meme post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/s/VjnGHKem5v ) acting as the victim who had OP‚Äôs custom mount strapped to their seat, to which the mods locked the post, and pinned a response:

> **Someone ruined my flight**
> 
> I board my flight and find some dude had literally STRAPPED his game controller thing to the back of MY seat headrest before I got there, it was wrapped around the cushion and everything.  I was embarrassed to ask him to take it down as he kept taking photos of it.
> 
> His friends kept hyping him up the whole time, calling him a ""madman"" and other crap, being way too loud for the flight. All I could hear for HOURS was this constant clicking from his cheap-looking turquoise controller.
> 
> I get wanting to game during a flight, but come on - that thing already has buttons on it, and the seats come with a table?!

[Mod comment after locking post:](https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/s/p5Dd2OU4WD)

> Mods: Enough memes about this topic please, it's getting pretty repetitive and having the whole sub against a single person isn't great whether you think what they did is stupid or not.

> Some were pretty funny, some were inappropriate but it's time to move on (and please don't harass that person).

Lycoris Recoil is an anime series about teenagers who protect Japan from terrorists to maintain peace. One of them is the main character and she has an idealistic personality. One the antagonists is a 30-year old terrorist guy who believes that there should be chaos in order to achieve balance. 

There is this user in r/LycorisRecoil who likes to the main character with the aforementioned antagonist. Every a few days, the user likes to share fanarts of this shipping in this subreddit and usually his posts are met with negative comments and downvotes. Sometimes mods eventually would threaten other users who reacted negatively with bans.

For those who are new to that subreddit, this particular user could come off as someone who simply just wants to share a fanart of his favorite ship. But, more often than not, he likes to repost his own past posts. From this observation, this user likes to cause drama in that subreddit.

#Background  
  
Skyrim is an RPG developed by Bethesda studios first released in 2011 and re-released so many times it's literally a [meme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQl3T0uD5Aw). One of the biggest things that has kept the game relevant over the years is it's large modding scene.  
  
One mod in particular is practically ubiquitous, the Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch. If you've played modded Skryim at all over the past 8 years and some change you've almost certainly played with this mod. Developed/run by Arthmoor, it's ostensibly a mod that focuses on patching out bugs and glitches, of which Skyrim has many. However over the years there's been a lot of arguments that the changes he's made have gone well beyond the scope of a bug fix mod and even being accused of veering into [breaking established lore](https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrim/comments/18c1v1t/psa_ussep_has_started_going_beyond_the_scope_of/).  
  
Arthmoor is also a controversial figure. He was [banned from r/SkyrimMods] (https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/atmzuj/rskyrimmods_1_modder_for_bethesda_games/), has [tried to use DMCA to take down other versions of his mod](https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/np8bi8/arthmoor_has_possibly_illegally_used_dmca_to_get/), and was the main cause of [GateGate](https://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=3514513#post409063738) where he included Oblivion Gates in a mod that people felt was completely unrelated, and threatened to sue anyone who uploaded a version of the mod that didn't have the gates in them.  
  
#Drama  
  
In comes user Zarowka123. Who posts in r/Skyrim [I heard that USSEP is making some non lore-friendly changes to the game, can someone give an example?](https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrim/comments/1ik2z2d/i_heard_that_ussep_is_making_some_non/) with the description (emphasis mine):  

> I don't want to offend anyone, *I never yet played with ussep*, but I see that this unofficial patch is widely hated here. Everyone is angry that this patch fixes various exploits and few days ago someone also said that it introduces some non lore-friendly changes to the game, but when I asked what changes he had on mind, I got downvote bombed and got no answers lol

The number of Trump supporters I heard say ""he's just joking he won't do that"" is hard to count.  
I'd say 95% of my friends and acquaintances are Trump supporters. I've yet to hear any of them have a negative reaction to any of his actions.

Also - don't gloat. Reinforce their feelings, and bring up things you might agree with.  
Privately I'm gloating my ass off. Everything they've drooled about having trump do is going to screw them the worst out of everyone. Everyone told them, and some very nicely, and all they did is insult us like 5 year olds.  
In my experience, it never takes a Republican voter more than a few weeks to relapse, and regress back to total party loyalty and parroting whatever they hear on Fox News.

[Bro, take this to heart. Anyone who only know, is flipping on Trump for something relatively minor (in the grand scheme of his crimes) is not a reliable ally...

This. Me losing fundamental human rights wasn't your dealbreaker, but your liquor being more expensive is?  
No one is unfurling the ""mission accomplished"" banner here...they're telling us about one dude who voted for trump and, two weeks into the term, is pissed about what he's doing...the sub is optimists unite. It's about sharing stories that pull people back in from abandoning all hope. It's sharing stories that restore a little bit of faith in the world.  
Personally I've never met anyone in my life who stayed mad about something trump did for more than a couple weeks.

No, just be cool.. don't be one of those ""I told you so"" people. Like it's not a good idea to alienate people just when they're about to start slowly opening up to your point of view.  
No, fuck that and fuck them. They shot the holes in the boat and we're all sinking. NO respect for the nazi sympathizers and pedophile apologists. **(this comment was made by a guy called aggressive-try lmao)**  
And yet this rhetoric will only make *more* of them by being so divisive.   
They're already divisive, they're nazies. No quarter for nazis.  
It's important to be outspoken, but we're shooting ourselves in the foot if we turn away anyone who's rethinking the blatantly deceptive propaganda they've been consuming their whole lives.  
The line has been crossed and they're a lost cause. Maybe you're happy to take in the nazi apologists, I never will.

Exhibit D: [Most of the Republicans I know have now come to their senses](https://www.reddit.com/r/OptimistsUnite/comments/1ihipac/most_of_the_republicans_i_know_have_now_come_to/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button): I've had numerous Republican friends in my red state who went from WOOHOO TRUMP to THAT FUCKER GONNA DESTROY OUR COUNTRY!

Same. I am in Arizona and know many MAGA. They are blissfully ignorant, thinking everything is going just dandy. I've given up on them ever sobering up. Trump is their savior.

Said this before- this kind of sentiment is going to be your doom. Embrace people who realise their mistakes. Otherwise, you incentivise them to hate you in return. You want more to people to join your opposition, not more people to remain your enemy.  
No one is immune to propaganda. How are you going to sit here and blame them when they are spoon fed lies at every turn? Have some empathy - you're not secretly a Trump voter, are you? :P  
Because I was spoonfed the same lies and called bullshit  
Exactly. They have good intentions and genuinely believe what they are doing is right. They have been taught that the left HATES them, so when confronted with anger, it further alienates them...you gotta talk about common ground and work from there.

There's no way that their optimism is going to last, and they are going to turn against him. All we have to do is wait as they watch and see what is really going on. It's gotta turn in our favor.

Me either. In fact, I've seen some ""friends"" posting pro Trump shit today  
Cut them out of your life, unfortunately have had to do this  
Not to side with the rigmarole below but this is bad advice. Cutting people off is exactly what has promoted the rapid radicalization of the right. Opposing viewpoints that seem pointless do in fact have an impact. We are all products of our environment so why not be a positive influence however futile it may feel.  
They are already radicalized. Cutting them off is a self preservation move.

[Isn't this like the 4th or 5th version of this same post today? Look folks. Try to be optimistic, sure. Bot we have lots and lots of work to do. We can't just sit and wait.

MAGA is a smaller part of Regular Republicans, when sain Republicans come around it will shock the MAGAS.  
We're gonna need those ""sane"" Republicans to speak the fuck up right about now  
8 years too late  
I am a regular Republican. MAGA is its own thing. I know just as many prior democrats who are maga as I do republicans. MAGA is its own thing that hijacked the Republican Party.  
Did you still vote for Trump though?  
You know they did

[no, they aren't. They love this shit](https://www.reddit.com/r/OptimistsUnite/comments/1ihxphf/comment/mb11yyd/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).

I've had several Republican friends in my conservative state who went from cheering for Trump to realizing, ""That guy's going to ruin our country!"" So, there's hope. A lot of it, actually, that things can improve and get done. :)  
[There's a difference between people who voted for Trump and MAGAS. MAGAS are a lost cause](https://www.reddit.com/r/OptimistsUnite/comments/1ii07n5/comment/mb1k296/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).  
I disagree. Trump = maga. They don't get to say ""I held my nose when I voted for him"" again. They are all complicit  
Anyone who voted for Trump is maga. Period...If you voted for Trump, you are a traitor to the US and a class traitor. Full stop, no exceptions.  
A lot of different groups voted for Trump. If we label them all as MAGA, and MAGA as incurable we've given up on winning ever again. I think it's better to have a more nuanced view and embrace people back into the fold when they admit wrong...people act predictably to incentives, and if we're deincentivizing dumping trump, fewer people will do it.   
Lol nice way to alienate the median voter. A lot of people simply think ""hmm my life slightly worsens under Biden so let's vote for the other side"" without even looking into Trump at all...if the Dems up their media game they would be easily converted  
Gloves are off, sorry

[It's a little late. Thanks anyway](https://www.reddit.com/r/OptimistsUnite/comments/1ii07n5/comment/mb1jn4l/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).  
That's more or less the problem. Right now there isn't nearly as much propaganda out there. So their heads are clearing up. In two years when the TV is full of it again they'll be back on the sauce. I've gone through this with right wingers. I can get them to agree with me... until they get in their car on turn on talk radio. Or go home and watch Fox News.  
Literally none of this is true. I don't watch a second of Fox news. Even Bill Maher woke up from the Libtard Left. Your completely full of it.  
12 day old account  
I'm getting really annoyed at these posts. One, I don't believe them...Two, fuck 'em  
If they don't pretend there's a notable movement of remorseful MAGAS, Democrats will have no excuse to cater to mythical moderate Republicans over majority of your country.  
Seriously. It's not just enough for them to wake up. You are responsible for getting us into this mess. It's not just enough for you to say you are concerned and then do nothing. You have to actually do something. You must serve some kind of penance.

I mean I've seen 3 of these posts today alone with the same wording. Probably bots tbh no conservatives have the ability to think critically.

Check out his comments. He's MAGA. And full of shit.

I'm one of those people. I didn't see it panning out like this. I don't remember seeing anything in the campaign about trade wars with our allies, US taking over Gaza, or Elon Musk being a God King. Screw all this, this is actual authoritarian behavior.  
The information was available. You chose to ignore it  
People are mad so they're not going to give you much grace in this. But thank you for seeing it for what it is and for letting us know it is possible.

Even if they change their mind, it'll be ""wow Trump really messed this up but he had good intentions"" and then in 28 trump won't be on the ballot and of course the new R whoever it is will be the last bastion of freedom against the red tide of communism and they'll fall in line.

# Contexts

r/LuckyStar is a subreddit for fans of the slice of life four panel manga/anime series Lucky Star. The series is about an otaku named Konata Izumi hanging out with her friends while talking about or immersing in anime and video games.

r/TeenagersButBetter is another version of r/teenagers, where teenagers post anything that other teenagers like to discuss about.

# The Call Out

A [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeenagersButBetter/comments/1ijfjgi/comment/mbfudma/) on the r/TeenagersButBetter subreddit is posted with the following title:

>**""Sometimes I regret making a Reddit account""**

The image attached is a screenshot of a thread.

>""Pedo type shit""

>> ""it's fictional""

>>> ""I'm sorry but when you jerk off to drawings of little girls the source is still irl little girls""

>>>> ""fictional little girls are not irl little girls""

Comments under this were aligned with OP's views. With the following comments:

>""I'd recommend YOU get help for trying to justify gooner art of children""

>"" ""I wonder how you justify shooting people in First Person Shooter video games.."" BITCH IT AINT THE SAME AS JERKING IT TO ART THAT LOOK LIKES LITTLE KIDS""

>""THE DOWNVOTE TO UPVOTE RATIO IS INSANE. JAIL THESE FUCKERS""

>Ok everyone downvote those pedos to the hubble deep field.

>Also somebody said they wanted to smash their breedable little child \*\*\*\*\*\*\*. I swear these people are the reason humanity sucks.

[OP then revealed](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeenagersButBetter/comments/1ijfjgi/comment/mbfudma/) that the comments came from a post with lolicon imagery from r/LuckyStar.

# The Brigade

Users of r/TeenagersButBetter brigaded r/LuckyStar's lolicon posts in the form of comments. Some comments include:

Back at r/TeenagersButBetter, there are mixed reactions to the brigade happening towards r/LuckyStar.

# r/LuckyStar's Reactions

To say that r/LuckyStar is negatively affected is an understatement, as users within the community made posts about this brigade.

People within it started to refer to the brigadiers as ""tourists,"" as per gatekeeping lingo. Here's some posts, and the comments under them.

What will r/TeenagersButBetter's next move be? Will r/LuckyStar ever get rid of these brigadiers? More news as updates come.


# Updates Are Here!

It seems that r/TeenagersButBetter's mods have removed the posts regarding on brigading r/LuckyStar, [as said here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeenagersButBetter/comments/1ik30x2/comment/mbj1bra/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).

On the other hand, r/LuckyStar's users [are still talking about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/luckystar/comments/1ik2902/regarding_recent_events/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) and someone from the derivative of the Lucky Star subreddit, r/LuckyStarSFW has made a [post on the main Lucky Star subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/luckystar/comments/1ijya4b/a_message_from_rluckystarsfw/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) also regarding the issue as well.

So, it seems the issue has simmered down ever since this post was made. This has been the wild ride for both r/TeenagersButBetter and r/LuckyStar.

1ijn7ld,subredditdrama,"Oh, shucks! OP bought some oysters and then asked /r/KitchenConfidential why they look and taste spoiled. Users think OP‚Äôs story is bs.","# Subreddit background

/r/KitchenConfidential is a subreddit for users previously in or currently in the food service industry. Because of their close knowledge of food safety and preparation always getting drilled into their heads, users can usually smell a bs story from miles away.

# OP‚Äôs oyster shucking blunder

The term, [‚Äúshucking an oyster‚Äù](https://ahiseafoodmarket.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/How-To-Shuck-An-Oyster-1024x683.png) refers to the process of preparing raw oyster meat for immediate consumption. Holding an oyster in one hand, you insert a knife into the hinge, and twist until the shell pops open (note: this kills the oyster). You then use the knife to completely separate the shell halves, leaving the oyster meat on the bottom shell.

OP, after getting some oysters, [posts the following:](https://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/s/4pxEswdUtF)

>  **Can anyone tell me what happened to these oysters?**
> 
> Freshly shucked and kept in a 1-3 degree (Celsius) fridge for 18 hours before taking them out. Massive black skirt on the edges - tried one and whilst no awful smell, tasted super unpleasant. Really confused‚Ä¶
> 
> *[image of shucked oysters on a rectangular tray. The oyster meat has an observable black lining around it]*

# Shucking experts chime in

[Story doesn‚Äôt add up:](https://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/s/FYE1dCEvYD)

> Wait.

> Freshly shucked.
> 
> Kept in the fridge for 18h.
> 
> Pick one.

> OP: For Christmas Day - bought from market first thing Christmas Eve as they‚Äôre not open Christmas Day - sorry should have specified.

> Shouldn't have opened them the day before

> OP: Sadly it‚Äôs how you had to buy them - same as every fish monger in the market üòï *[downvoted]*

> Gross, I would never buy a preshucked oyster unless I'm about to eat it.

> Being from an island that specializes in oysters, I am shocked they sell them on the half shell. Those oysters are alive until they‚Äôre shucked, then they‚Äôre dead. That window for eating raw dead things is pretty small.

> ‚ÄúThat window for eating raw dead things is pretty small‚Äù is such simple yet abundant wisdom lol

> I hear I'm extreme for not eating animals at all but, eating raw dead things is chill? *[downvoted]*

[Always chill raw food:](https://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/s/gUctOcM5vj)

[OP is lying:](https://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/s/1qGk3gFXaH)

> Yeah, I don‚Äôt believe OP. Every fishmonger at this market is willing to give their customers food poisoning by only selling open oysters? Nah, OP opened them the day before to save himself some time on Christmas Day.

> Nah. Typically, these are frozen on the halfshell.
> 
> No one is gonna shuck oysters and store them like that unless it's resale.

> Yeah the packaging looks like they were a frozen package. No way every market store is selling dead raw food

> You can buy oysters like this, same as the  OP photo, in Australia in practically any supermarket (if you‚Äôre not going to the fishmongers). It‚Äôs not frozen when you purchase it.

> Are they meant for eating raw or cooking?

[These oysters *are* safe to eat:](https://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/s/wTPuphWLFR)

> The black line around the edge is the mantle - all oysters (and bivalve mollusks) have them - if you look closely on the mantle of scallops, you can see all the eyes - but after they‚Äôve been shucked for awhile, the pigmentation sometimes turns the liquor a dark color. Whoever opened them flipped them upside down, so maybe the inside was punctured, which also discolors any liquid it comes in content with - there‚Äôs a digestive tract inside that is packed with dark stuff.
> 
> They‚Äôre probably fine to eat but maybe give them a wipe around the edges. These look like Kusshi oysters, or maybe Stellar Bays or something from the Vancouver area?  I almost thought Kumamoto but the shells don‚Äôt look thick enough.

> Please don‚Äôt ever repeat this. No, you cannot eat bivalves that have been shucked 18 fucking hours prior to consumption. OP is about to be really ill.

> Pre-shucked oysters get consumed every day. Not ideal, but certainly not fatal.

> Preshucked. Yep, right before serving raw. Not hours before. I‚Äôd like to speak to your municipal health department

> Oysters are sold in preshucked gallons for foodservice applications. The ‚Äúbest by‚Äù date on the container is sometimes more than two weeks after shucking. I wish I could take a picture of one for you - the wording is ‚Äúnot recommended to be consumed raw.‚Äù  Ideally not served raw but it does happen. I am definitely not a fan.  Even cooked they have a weird consistency.

> I‚Äôd like you to send those photos to the health department and see if they agree with me or you.

> Believe it or not, you can buy them frozen like this on trays. I‚Äôve never purchased them but I saw someone bring them out once at a Chinese Buffet place.

> another comment clarifies that OP was not allowed to buy them whole and could only buy them already-dead. i wanna have a word or two with the seller lmao

> My guess is he's embarrassed and changing some details lol

> That's pretty spot on behavior for a recruiter.

> Holy shit this comment killed me, 100% accurate per my experience

> Looking at the packaging, I'm inclined to believe their story that it was bought shucked. I can't imagine someone having a tray like that

> Yeah, but did he ask for them shucked and ready to serve, or was he ""not allowed"" to buy them any other way. That's the changed detail.

# Update from OP

After over 24 hours of consuming the oyster, [OP provides a much anticipated update:](https://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/s/bzIAf6MiJ8)

> OP: UPDATE: So this blew up a bit more than I thought, but here‚Äôs some context and personal update for those wondering‚Ä¶
> 
> * This is in Australia - someone commented that on Christmas Eve here people buy thousands of shucked oysters on Christmas Eve to have on Christmas Day - super normal and have done many times in the past without issue.
> 
> * The oysters are from Bruny Island in Tasmania - and they weren‚Äôt for service.
> 
> * Surprisingly, even to myself, 24 hours after eating one of them I feel absolutely fine which is very unexpected after reading so many comments saying the opposite.
> 
> * Yes I threw out the rest
> 
> Seems like the general consensus is that they were likely older stock and they died pretty quickly after opening, regardless of being in a cold fridge. Appreciate the concern from everyone and thank you for some serious laughs as well as some learnings from the comments!
> 
> Lesson is I‚Äôll be shucking them myself on Christmas Day going forward, seems like the most bulletproof idea.
> 
> Happy holidays and Merry Christmas to those who celebrate!
> 
> Any other questions happy to answer here - cheers

> Oh the classic recruiter sign off üòÇ love it

> Bro, they always die when you open them no matter what. No one with five brain cells, regardless of country, is buying shucked oysters to eat the following day. You still don‚Äôt seem to understand.

> OP: My guy - trust me I get this - I‚Äôve eaten a hell of a lot of oysters in my life - but from what everyone‚Äôs saying these had been dead a whiiiile.
> 
> Also RE buying the day before Christmas - thousands, and I mean thousands of Australians - particularly in Melbourne and Sydney - buy shucked oysters on Christmas Eve to eat on Christmas Day. Also from some seriously reputable fishmongers. Will I be doing that again after this? Absolutely not. But I promise it is the norm here and we have some incredible oysters.

> Americans just can't comprehend things are different outside their country. Maybe you just eat shitty produce.

> ‚Ä¶oysters are produce? Oysters don‚Äôt die in your country when you shuck them Fascinating.

> You know fish and cows have been dead for days/weeks and we eat them raw?
> 
> Must only be shitty US oysters that give you food poisoning instantly???

> Y'know there's a huge difference between fish/beef and shellfish, right? You know there's a reason lobsters are kept alive until they're ready to be cooked, right? Shellfish decomposes INCREDIBLY fast. Please, don't be daft.

Today, I brought it up for clarification...and she definitely clarified. We don't have sex often if at all. In fact, we haven't been intimate for over 3 years. The simple fact of the matter is, she's not that interested in sex. We love each other and are dedicated  to each other, but in her words she doesn't want to deprive me of sex simply because she isn't that interested in it. She explained that as long as I don't catch feelings or get anyone pregnant, she's ok with me pursuing whomever I want for physical intimacy. And I must state, she has never gone outside our relationship for sex either. Again, she's just not interested; she just wants me to have physical intimacy.

My question is...what do? I mean. I guess I'm not opposed to sex, but I've never thought about actively seeking it outside our marriage. An outside perspective **WITHOUT JUDGEMENT** would be most welcome, so I am appealing to the wider Reddit audience for opinions. Thanks so much in advance!

My question is what does boycotting ACTUALLY do, on the company‚Äôs side? I assume they see a decline in sales, but it feels like such a tiny change for megacorps like McDonalds or Amazon. How would they know the small decline in sales is from boycotting and not from just a general dip in sales?

I just received a job offer and need some advice. The position is for a service technician role with full travel commitment (5 days a week on the road, home only on weekends).

The offer includes 9 months of training in Germany before relocating to Kennesaw, Georgia (near Atlanta). The salary is $75,000 per year.

I‚Äôd be moving with my wife and two kids (2.5 years & 2.5 months old). Currently, we‚Äôre the only income in the household. Given the cost of living, taxes, healthcare, etc., would this salary be enough to support a family of four? Also, does the work-life balance seem reasonable for a family?
